Spring HATEOAS offers three abstractions for creating the URI â€“ RepresentationModel, Link, and WebMvcLinkBuilder. We can use these to create
 the metadata and associate it to the resource representation.



Get all Customers
================

http://localhost:9090/customers

Get all orders for a customer:
==============================


http://localhost:9090/customers/10A/orders



Note:  The URI associated with the response is qualified as a self link.
