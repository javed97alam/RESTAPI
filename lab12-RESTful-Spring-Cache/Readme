@EnableCaching
==========

It enables Springâ€™s annotation-driven cache management capability.  

Spring provides one concurrent hashmap as default cache, but we can override 
CacheManager to register external cache providers as well easily.

We can override specific cache behaviors in Spring boot by overriding the cache 
provider specific settings.
